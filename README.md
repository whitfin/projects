# Projects

This repository contains a bunch of project notes, state and tracking. This is mainly for personal use as my mind tends to operate better with something minimal, but it might become public because why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. You shouldn't expect coherent documentation in this repository, as it serves as mainly a personal utility. Notes can be:

- shorthand (and thus make little sense)
- based on existing projects (design notes)
- based on upcoming projects (conceptualizing)
- based on broad ideas (essentially "get something on paper")
- copy/paste for reference later

### Package Downloads

The document entitled [DOWNLOADS.md](./DOWNLOADS.md) contains a generated (via [gen-downloads](./scripts/gen-downloads.js)) set of download counts for many authored projects. This serves no particular purpose aside from wanting to use [shields.io](https://shields.io) to render for me - because download counts are a pain :). This page will contain links to the source repository under the left columns, as well as their location on the specified package manager in the right column.

### Permission & Reuse

There are no explicit permissions granted to use any ideas or content from this repository; if you wish to re-use any of the content in here, please reach out and let me know and we'll figure it out. I'd prefer to work together on any ideas rather than end up duplicating any effort, after all!
